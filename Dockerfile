# NOTE: the genesis seed bake was RETIRED in June 2026. The live /data/adai.db
# (continuously replicated to R2 by Litestream) is the ONLY source of truth —
# there is no reseed-from-JSON step and the image ships no seed.db. A fresh host
# recovers the live DB from the Litestream replica (see entrypoint.sh). The old
# seed/*.json canon + offline pipeline were removed June 2026 (in git history).
